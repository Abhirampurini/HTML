<p><b>The name of the world’s first virtual brain. That means a machine that can function as human brain.</b></p> <br><i> Today scientists are in research to create an artificial brain that can think, response, take decision, and keep anything in memory. The main aim is to upload human brain into machine.</i> <br> <strike>So that man can think, take decision without any effort. After the death of the body, the virtual brain will act as the man.</strike><br><u>So, even after the death of a person we will not loss the knowledge, intelligence, personalities, feelings and memories of  that  man that can be used for the development of the human society.</u><br> No one has ever understood the complexity of human brain.<br>
       <font color="green" size="4">It is complex than any circuitry in the world. So, question may arise <font color="pink">“Is it really possible to create a human brain?”</font> The answer is “Yes”. Because whatever man has created today always he has followed the nature.  When man does not have a device called computer, it was a big question for all. Technology is growing faster than everything. IBM is now in research to create a virtual brain, called “Blue brain”. If possible, this would be the first virtual brain of the world. Within 30 years, we will be able to scan ourselves into the computers. Is this the beginning of eternal life.</font>
